description_instructions: These descriptions are taken from the National Vulnerability Database, and can be kind of jargony. Rewrite this in your own words to be easier to read. We can always pull up the NVD description later. Please remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon that outsiders to Chromium would not understand.
description: The regex implementation in Google's Javascript engine *V8* allows remote attackers to cause an invalid write operation to memory. This could cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

unit_tested:
  question:
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    More specifically, was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? (code).

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding code near the fix and determine if
    and was there were unit tests involved for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  fix:  true
  unclear: # Place any reasons for which you believe the data is unclear on this point. here

discovered:
  question:
    How was this vulnerability discovered? Go to the bug report and
    read the conversation to find out how this was originally found. Answer in
    longform below, fill in the date, and then determine if the vulnerability was
    found by a Google employee (you can tell from their email address).
  answer: Found using LangFuzz, then reproduced by hand. Nobody was able to construct an exploit, but they were also not comfortable stating that an exploit was impossible.

subsystem:
  question:
    What subsystems was the mistake in? Look at the path of the source
    code files code that were fixed to get directory names. Look at comments in
    the code. Look at the bug reports how the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on the description in the CVE and blog post.
  name: v8

major_events:
  question:
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem changed? Did the team change? The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather, we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer:
  events:
    - event: # don't put anything here
        name: # Describe in under 50 chars
        date: # YYYY-MM-DD
    - event: # don't put anything here
        name: # Describe in under 50 chars
        date: # YYYY-MM-DD
        # ... add more if you found more events
linguistics:
  question:
    Examine the discussions between the VCC and the fix. Look at the code reviews, the bug reports, and any other discussion you happen to come across.

    Look for how they use the English language.
    Politeness - are people thanking each other? Expressing appreciation? Asking
      nicely? Or is it more terse?
    Rudeness - did you see a conversation get heated or opinionated?
    Questioning - is feedback being given in the form of a question? Are
      developers questioned about the decisions they made?
  answer: # Provide a thoughtful, interesting response. 50-100 word.
  polite:
    url: # Provide a link to an example if you find one
    description: # Explain briefly
  rude:   # true, false, or just leave blank
    url: # Provide a link to an example if you find one
    description: # Explain briefly
  questioning:
    url: # Provide a link to an example if you find one
    description: # Explain briefly
mistakes:
  question:
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made
    that led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations they
    have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: The coding mistake that was made was essentially an integer overflow that led to miscalculating memory buffers. The mistake was not in the underlying native code, rather, it was misusing the C API. So the fix was actually in the Javascript implementation of regexp. The vulnerability was introduced over two commits, but reall by one person who was working on trying to fix this boundary condition. They weren't working on a vulnerability per se, but they were working on a boundary condition and still missed this one condition.
